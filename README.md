# Project Gyaan

Project Gyaan is an intelligent article curator that automatically discovers, evaluates, and delivers high-quality, thought-provoking content straight to your inbox.

- **Intelligent Evaluation**:
  - Uses Google's Gemini AI to evaluate content
  - Scores articles on impact, originality, and depth
  - Estimates reading time and value proposition
  - Filters out low-quality or superficial content

## Testing

To test the setup, run:
```bash
python test_curator.py
```

This will:
- Test Reddit article extraction
- Test content processing
- Test Gemini evaluation
- Send a test email digest

## Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in the code:
- `batch_size`: Number of articles evaluated together (default: 3)
- `min_score`: Minimum quality scores (impact: 7, originality: 6)
- Sleep delays between API calls (adjustable for rate limiting)

## Current Limitations

- Runs locally only (no GitHub Actions deployment yet)
- Some paywalled content may be inaccessible
- Rate limits on various APIs may affect processing time

## Contributing
